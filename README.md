# Type of dataset: Iris Dataset: the Iris dataset is fundamentally a classification dataset, making it ideal for logistic regression and other classification algorithms. 
# Its primary use is to predict the categorical species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on its features. The original Iris dataset is used for multi-class classification.

# Method: 
#### 1. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
#### 2. MLPClassifier
#### 3. Fully connected (Dense) layers

# Type of dataset: the dataset type is regression

# Method: MLPRegressor is a machine learning model, typically found in libraries such as scikit-learn, that uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to perform regression tasks. 
# In a regression problem, the goal is to predict a continuous output value (e.g., house price, income) rather than a discrete class label.
